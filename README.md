# ✨ Sentiment Predictor

This is a Streamlit-based app that predicts the sentiment of a tweet or text message using a logistic regression classifier. The app also supports sentiment prediction from uploaded images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) via `pytesseract`.

## 🔍 Features

- Clean and preprocess tweets
- Train and evaluate a logistic regression model using TF-IDF features
- Display classification report and confusion matrix
- Extract top 3 keywords for each sentiment class
- Generate and save a word cloud
- Predict sentiment from user input or uploaded image

## 🧠 Model

- **Vectorizer**: TF-IDF with 5000 max features
- **Classifier**: Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation**:
  - Macro F1 score
  - Confusion matrix (saved to `images/confusion_matrix.png`)
  - Classification report (saved to `reports/sentiment_report.txt`)

## 🖼️ Visuals

- Word cloud saved to `images/wordcloud.png`
- Top entities saved to `reports/top_entities.txt`
